**PhytoEvolve** is an interactive web-based evolution simulator inspired by Dinophytes â€” a group of unique, single-celled organisms. Itâ€™s a fusion of **biology, digital art, and artificial intelligence**.

The simulation lets users interact with visual traits, triggering a generational evolution process guided by AI-driven selection.
